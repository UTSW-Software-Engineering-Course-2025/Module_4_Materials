## Expectation-Maximization algorithm for hidden Markov models

Instructor:
Jungsik Noh (jungsik.noh@UTSouthwestern.edu)

Overall goals: The goal of this block is to implement an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for autoregressive hidden Markov models (AR-HMMs) using Matlab. The algorithm will be applied to infer discrete neuronal spike events from calcium activity time courses obtained from calcium imaging data. Students will learn the principles of the EM algorithm and key concepts on Markov chains and HMMs. An incomplete codebase and toy data will be provided for students to write their own core functions for the EM implementation. This exercise emphasizes the importance of numerical stability in iterative optimization. 

### Home work
Each day can have both math and coding exercises.

1. Submit physical reports for math exercises on the next class day (don't need to type them).
2. Submit coding exercises by uploading the codes into 'day_x' folder under a new repository named 'Module_4_(student name)'.
